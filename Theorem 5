(*proof for peirce law which says that (((P->Q)->P)->P) *)

Definition peirce := forall (p q : Prop),
  ((p -> q) -> p) -> p.

Definition lem := forall p, p \/ -p.

Theorem peirce_equiv_lem: peirce <-> lem.
Proof.
  unfold peirce, lem.
  firstorder.
  apply H with (q := - (p \/ -p)).
  firstorder.
  destruct (H p).
  assumption.
  tauto.
Qed.
